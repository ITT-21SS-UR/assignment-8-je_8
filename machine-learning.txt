1) What is the title of the paper?

> "Avoiding Pitfalls When Using Machine Learning in HCI Studies"

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
2) What are some common use cases for machine learning in practical applications or research prototypes?

> Model human behavior, develop and predict novel user interactions, gestures regognition, 
optimize system resources, provide intelligent mobile notifications

3. Which problems of machine learning do the authors of the paper identify? 
   Explain one of them in detail.

> One problem of machine learning methods is that the prediction accuracy cannot replace 
classic hypothesis testing and correlation or causation analysis. This accours e.g. when acquiring 
conclusions about human behavior. Researches have be really careful with interpretations about the 
classifications of human behavior and if they are really linked to the emotional state of the users.
